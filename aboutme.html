        <h2>History</h2>
        <h3>Sports</h3>
        <p>Sports played a big role in my upbrining. During elementary and middle school, my favorite ones were basketball and sparring. For basketball, I played on the school team, a recreational team, as well on a travel team. As I grew older,however, I started to realize the limited path I was destined for due to my genetics.

All at the same time, I had the academic schedule of an elite student. I do believe that these years, however painful, gave my the confidence that I can do really hard things you just need to really push yourself to uncomftorable places. I also do belive that in the long run, although I could have been coding or taking additional courses instead, these expiercnes help make me unique from other technical folks.
