           Currently, I am  a sophmore at <a href="https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html">Emory University</a> double majoring in <a href="https://apply.emory.edu/majors/applied-mathematics-and-statistics.html#:~:text=This%20major%20is%20for%20people,Theory%20and%20Methods%20(QTM).">Applied Math and Stats(BS)</a> as well as <a href="https://computerscience.emory.edu/undergraduate/degrees-and-requirements/cs-major-ba.html"> Computer Science(BA)</a>. Outside of my courses at Emory, I am involved in <a href="https://www.math.emory.edu/~yxi26/students.html">Professor Xi's Machine Learning Reading group</a><a href="https://www.algorycapital.com/"> , Algory Capital's </a> QI division, Emory Sports data analytics club, being  a <a href="https://oue.college.emory.edu/programs/success/tutoring.html"> peer tutor  </a>  for linear algebra   and more. Currently, my main focus is to acquire more practical computer science skills such as front-end/back-end technologies to eventuallly be able to integrate ML tools in more useful settings and in general be able to tinker and implement some of my own  ideas into reality.
           On this website you can find history about me, my current interests and goals, as well as information about  my academics and extracuricualars.
